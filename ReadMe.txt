    IPPC: Interprocess Procedure Calling - Project Overview
========================================================================

A very interesting tool that can be used to call procedures exported by other process spaces. This exposes many opportunities for useful applications, the project is commented very well in the hopes it'd be easy to understand for you. The code comes in an API format - easy to insert and applicate.

All code where my signature appears is my own, and I ask you treat it as such. You're free to adapt code to your own projects as long as due credit is given. The best way to give credit is to leave my signature where it should be AND/OR provide my GitHub in any sources you release or applications you develop.
